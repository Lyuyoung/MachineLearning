Identify Fraud from Enron Email By Python Scikit

n 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

Play detective and use machine learning skills to build an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

Starter code on git: git clone https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git

When making classifier, I create three pickle files (my_dataset.pkl, my_classifier.pkl, my_feature_list.pkl). The project evaluator will test these using the tester.py script. Notably, run poi_id.py to generate the three pickle files that reflect final algorithm.
